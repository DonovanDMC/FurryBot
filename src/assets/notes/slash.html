	<title>Furry Bot - Slash Commands Note</title>

		<p>
			Discord has introduced a new feature, slash commands. You can see an example <a
				href="https://i.furry.bot/slash-commands.png">here</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using these requires a new thing when inviting the bot, so servers that have previously had the bot in them
			will need to reinvite it.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can find an invite <a href="https://furry.bot/inv">here</a>, or by using the <b>f!invite</b> command.
		</p>
		<p>
			I highly recommend using the slash command variant of a command if it exists. They come with better help
			than we can supply.
